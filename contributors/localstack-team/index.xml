Developers are faced with a slow and tedious code ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí test ‚Üí redeploy ‚Üí &amp;hellip; cycle and often find themselves packaging and uploading their serverless applications tens or hundreds of times a day. These inherent limitations and hurdles in developing cloud applications have caused some folks to compare the cloud to the new mainframe era.</description></item></channel></rss>
