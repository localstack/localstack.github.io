Using LocalStack, you can execute your Lambda functions locally without the need to deploy them to AWS. This is a great way to test your code and learn more about how your Lambda functions work before deploying them to AWS. But there is always a question about debugging the Lambda functions from your IDE before deploying it.</description></item><item><title>Hot Swapping Python Lambda Functions using LocalStack</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-03-07-hot-swapping-python-lambda-functions-using-localstack/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 08:53:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-03-07-hot-swapping-python-lambda-functions-using-localstack/</guid><description>AWS Lambda is a Serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) system that allows you to write code in your favorite programming language and run it on the AWS ecosystem. Unlike deploying your code on a server, you can now break down your application into many independent functions and deploy them as a singular units. With the help of AWS Lambda, you can strive for more modular code that can be tested and debugged while integrated with the AWS infrastructure and your core system.</description></item></channel></rss>
