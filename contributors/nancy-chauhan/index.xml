The dev environment should mimic the production environment as closely as possible. This comes with a cost: testing cloud applications is cumbersome as they have many moving parts. For instance, if you build a simple Lambda function in AWS, you might use services such as CloudWatch, S3, IAM, etc.
Imagine configuring your project and provisioning these cloud resources in a test environment every time for developing new features.</description></item></channel></rss>
