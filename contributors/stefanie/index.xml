Keeping parity with AWS has been our mission at LocalStack since day one. This is essential for building a reliable cloud emulator that provides a great experience for cloud application developers.
Recently we introduced new mechanisms to scale the endeavor and ensure that the parity of LocalStack with AWS increases continuously over time while keeping our service implementations up-to-date.</description></item><item><title>Monitor your failing Lambdas with CloudWatch and LocalStack</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-05-25-cloudwatch-metric-alarms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-05-25-cloudwatch-metric-alarms/</guid><description>AWS CloudWatch is a service that enables monitoring of your AWS infrastructure by collecting logs and operational metrics of your deployment. An integral part of infrastructure operations is reacting in real-time to anomalous changes in metrics, e.g., spiking disk or CPU usage or failures in your serverless functions. This is where CloudWatch metric alarms and actions come into play, which you can now develop and test using LocalStack!</description></item></channel></rss>
