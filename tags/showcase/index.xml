The dev environment should mimic the production environment as closely as possible. This comes with a cost: testing cloud applications is cumbersome as they have many moving parts. For instance, if you build a simple Lambda function in AWS, you might use services such as CloudWatch, S3, IAM, etc.
Imagine configuring your project and provisioning these cloud resources in a test environment every time for developing new features.</description></item><item><title>Test Monitoring for LocalStack Apps</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2021-09-16-test-monitoring-for-localstack-apps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:10:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2021-09-16-test-monitoring-for-localstack-apps/</guid><description>LocalStack gives developers the freedom to develop their cloud applications locally (even offline) - enabling a highly efficient dev&amp;amp;test loop. It also helps prevent scary cloud bills at the end of every month! LocalStack has an amazing community of users, contributors, and supporters - and generally demonstrates a very strong commitment to supporting open source.
The community uses LocalStack for many use cases such as developing microservice cloud applications. One of the strongest use cases why developers use LocalStack is “testing”.</description></item></channel></rss>
