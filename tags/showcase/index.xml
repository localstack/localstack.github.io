LocalStackâ€™s core cloud emulator runs inside a Docker container and provides a set of external network ports for integrations, SDKs, or CI providers for developers to execute their cloud &amp;amp; serverless applications fully locally without talking to the real cloud services. This enables a highly efficient development loop, by reducing the feedback cycles from minutes to seconds.</description></item><item><title>LocalStack x Gitpod - Run cloud applications with LocalStack and Gitpod</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-09-26-localstack-x-gitpod-run-cloud-applications-with-localstack-and-gitpod/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 11:31:19 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-09-26-localstack-x-gitpod-run-cloud-applications-with-localstack-and-gitpod/</guid><description>Shipping applications to production requires them to be battle-tested in the dev environment. The dev environment should mimic the production environment as closely as possible. This comes with a cost: testing cloud applications is cumbersome as they have many moving parts. For instance, if you build a simple Lambda function in AWS, you might use services such as CloudWatch, S3, IAM, etc.
Imagine configuring your project and provisioning these cloud resources in a test environment every time for developing new features.</description></item><item><title>Test Monitoring for LocalStack Apps</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2021-09-16-test-monitoring-for-localstack-apps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:10:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2021-09-16-test-monitoring-for-localstack-apps/</guid><description>ðŸ“¢ Thundra Inc and its product Foresight have ceased operations and have been acquired by Catchpoint, resulting in significant changes to their products and services.
