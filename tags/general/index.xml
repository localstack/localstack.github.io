At its core, LocalStack provides a cloud service emulation layer that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment. With LocalStack, you can run your AWS services or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider.
LocalStack focuses on developer experience (DevX) and offers a number of team collaboration features on top of the core emulation layer, like advanced persistence mechanisms that allow reuse and sharing of resources among team members and across environments.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://localstack.cloud/faq/1-available-services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/faq/1-available-services/</guid><description>The overview of different usage tiers (Open Source, Pro, Enterprise) can be found at LocalStack Features page
