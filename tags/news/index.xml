This major release is a significant milestone towards our vision to propel developer productivity - by allowing dev teams to quickly and conveniently develop &amp;amp; test their cloud applications locally and across the CI/CD pipeline.
At LocalStack, we&amp;rsquo;re working to provide a better way to develop and test your cloud applications. Our platform is redefining cloud development by enabling a highly efficient, fully local development &amp;amp; testing loop and giving developers back control over their environments.</description></item><item><title>LocalStack and AWS Parity Explained</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-08-04-parity-explained/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-08-04-parity-explained/</guid><description>Parity for LocalStack means that when you, as a cloud developer, make an AWS API call to LocalStack&amp;rsquo;s cloud emulator, it behaves the same way AWS would.
Keeping parity with AWS has been our mission at LocalStack since day one. This is essential for building a reliable cloud emulator that provides a great experience for cloud application developers.
Recently we introduced new mechanisms to scale the endeavor and ensure that the parity of LocalStack with AWS increases continuously over time while keeping our service implementations up-to-date.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Pods - Enabling state sharing and team collaboration for local cloud development</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-08-26-cloud-pods/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-08-26-cloud-pods/</guid><description>Background: Ephemeral and persistent state in LocalStack By default, the state of all services in LocalStack is ephemeral - i.e., whenever you restart the LocalStack Docker container, it presents a fresh instance with a clean state that can be used to create your application resources locally. This is the default mode, which is optimized for quick experimentation, and frequent container restarts, making sure to always start with a clean slate.</description></item><item><title>Announcing LocalStack Extensions</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-09-12-announcing-localstack-extensions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 05:51:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-09-12-announcing-localstack-extensions/</guid><description>With the LocalStack 1.0 General Availability going live last month, we announced LocalStack Extensions!

Developers are faced with a slow and tedious code â†’ deploy â†’ test â†’ redeploy â†’ &amp;hellip; cycle and often find themselves packaging and uploading their serverless applications tens or hundreds of times a day. These inherent limitations and hurdles in developing cloud applications have caused some folks to compare the cloud to the new mainframe era.</description></item></channel></rss>
