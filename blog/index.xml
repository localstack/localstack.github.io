Keeping parity with AWS has been our mission at LocalStack since day one. This is essential for building a reliable cloud emulator that provides a great experience for cloud application developers.
Recently we introduced new mechanisms to scale the endeavor and ensure that the parity of LocalStack with AWS increases continuously over time while keeping our service implementations up-to-date.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Pods - Enabling state sharing and team collaboration for local cloud development</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-08-26-cloud-pods/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-08-26-cloud-pods/</guid><description>üì¢ Cloud Pods have seen a lot of improvements since this blog post was published.

LocalStack‚Äôs core cloud emulator runs inside a Docker container and provides a set of external network ports for integrations, SDKs, or CI providers for developers to execute their cloud &amp;amp; serverless applications fully locally without talking to the real cloud services. This enables a highly efficient development loop, by reducing the feedback cycles from minutes to seconds.</description></item><item><title>KnowBe4 redefines their local cloud development &amp; testing using LocalStack</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2023-04-24-case-study-knowbe4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2023-04-24-case-study-knowbe4/</guid><description>‚ÄúLocalStack has been a game changer in terms of development speed and efficiency for our team migrating our monolithic application to a serverless Node.js stack on AWS.‚Äù

The dev environment should mimic the production environment as closely as possible. This comes with a cost: testing cloud applications is cumbersome as they have many moving parts. For instance, if you build a simple Lambda function in AWS, you might use services such as CloudWatch, S3, IAM, etc.
Imagine configuring your project and provisioning these cloud resources in a test environment every time for developing new features.</description></item><item><title>Announcing LocalStack 1.0 General Availability!</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-07-13-announcing-localstack-v1-general-availability/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 11:00:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-07-13-announcing-localstack-v1-general-availability/</guid><description>Today, we are excited to announce the general availability of LocalStack 1.0. This major release is a significant milestone towards our vision to propel developer productivity - by allowing dev teams to quickly and conveniently develop &amp;amp; test their cloud applications locally and across the CI/CD pipeline.
