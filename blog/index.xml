Keeping parity with AWS has been our mission at LocalStack since day one. This is essential for building a reliable cloud emulator that provides a great experience for cloud application developers.
Recently we introduced new mechanisms to scale the endeavor and ensure that the parity of LocalStack with AWS increases continuously over time while keeping our service implementations up-to-date.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Pods - Enabling state sharing and team collaboration for local cloud development</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-08-26-cloud-pods/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-08-26-cloud-pods/</guid><description>üì¢ Cloud Pods have seen a lot of improvements since this blog post was published.
