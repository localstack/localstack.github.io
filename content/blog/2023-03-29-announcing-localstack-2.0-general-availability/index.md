Last year we announced the general availability of LocalStack 1.0, our first major release, to help development teams propel their productivity by developing & testing their cloud applications locally! Between then and now, LocalStack has achieved significant adoption and amassed over 135 million Docker pulls and thousands of new customers worldwide! As we continue to execute  our vision of making LocalStack the go-to platform for local cloud development, we are excited to announce our latest major release!

Today we are excited to announce the general availability of LocalStack 2.0, our next-generation cloud emulation platform, focused on providing a better way to develop and test your cloud applications. This release is significant for us, as it expands our scope of building a frictionless, integrated cloud developer experience for our users. LocalStack 2.0 is our second major release with many new features, enhancements, and improved parity for more extensive integration across the AWS tooling ecosystem. 

With the 2.0 release, LocalStack offers the most comprehensive local cloud development platform that enables our users and customers to continue boosting their individual productivity and team collaboration. As we continue to build on the feedback and deliver value for our community and users, we look forward to seeing the local cloud development paradigm adopted en masse to give developers back control over their environments. In this blog, we will look at what’s new in LocalStack 2.0, highlight new features and enhancements, and discuss how you can get the most out of them!

## What’s new in LocalStack 2.0?

LocalStack 2.0 delivers our strong investment across three  critical areas — parity, performance, and interoperability to provide the best developer experience. With LocalStack 2.0, we have significantly optimized the internals of the platform and moved to new service implementations, images, and internal toolings to make it easy for developers to build & test their cloud applications locally! LocalStack 2.0 is an exciting leap forward in our mission to make local cloud development possible, and we recommend you try out our new features and share your feedback with us!

Let us take a look at our new features and enhancements, and what you can benefit from when using our latest release!
