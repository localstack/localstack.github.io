In this blog post, we're excited to announce our latest developments around Cloud Pods - persistent state snapshots that enable next-generation state management and team collaboration features in LocalStack.

# Background: Ephemeral and persistent state in LocalStack

By default, the state of all services in LocalStack is ephemeral - i.e., whenever you restart the LocalStack Docker container, it presents a fresh instance with a clean state that can be used to create your application resources locally. This is the default mode, which is optimized for quick experimentation, and frequent container restarts, making sure to always start with a clean slate.

Our Pro version supports advanced persistence - a simple config flag `PERSISTENCE=1` can be used to enable the **persistence** of resources. The purpose of persistence is to ensure that the service state survives container restarts, in case youâ€™re stopping and re-starting the LocalStack instance on the same machine.

Persistence is a great feature, as it allows our users to pause execution and then resume their work from the exact same application state. In some cases, however, youâ€™d want to have more control over managing the state. This is where **Cloud Pods** come into play - cloud pods allow you to take a snapshot of the state at any point in time, and then selectively restore, merge, and inject it into your instance.

# Cloud Pods - persistent shareable state snapshots

Cloud pods are persistent state snapshots of your LocalStack instance that can easily be stored, versioned, shared, and restored. If youâ€™re familiar with the `git` version control system, some of the concepts and commands of cloud pods will be familiar to you as well.

The figure below illustrates the main differences between persistence and Cloud Pods in LocalStack. Persistence ensures that any state changes happening within your instance are written to a persistent volume, such that the state gets restored when you restart your LocalStack instance next time.

With Cloud pods, on the other hand, we keep local storage for your state files that can be used to `commit` (take a snapshot of the running instance) and `inject` state (restore the snapshot into the running instance). In addition, we provide a secure remote Cloud Pods storage backend, that can be used to conveniently `push` and `pull` the state - making it extremely simple to share the state of your current instance with your team members.

## Basic Use Case

What does this mean in practice, how can we use Cloud Pods in the wild? Letâ€™s consider the following simple use case.

Assume weâ€™d like to make some changes to our LocalStack instance for project A, and then store the state, so that we can continue with some other work for project B, before coming back to continue working on project A later on.

First, letâ€™s create some state in the local instance, and then we can `commit` (store) the state in a cloud pod named `p1`:

```bash
# create some resources in LocalStack (for project A)
$ awslocal s3 mb s3://test-bucket
$ awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name test-queue
# commit the state to pod p1
$ localstack pod commit --name p1
```

Later on - after restarting the LocalStack container with a fresh state, we can `inject` (restore) the previous state of the local instance to continue where we left off.

```bash
# restart LocalStack with a fresh state
$ localstack pod inject --name p1
```

For a full list of operations, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/tools/cloud-pods/pods-cli/).

## Pod Inspect

After committing or pushing the state of a cloud pod, we can take a look at the high-level contents that are contained in it. Letâ€™s use the `inspect` command from the terminal to display the contents of the pod `p1` that we just created before

```bash
$ localstack pod inspect --name p1
```

This will open an interactive shell that lists the resources contained in the pod - in our case, the S3 bucket `test-bucket`, as well as the SQS queue `test-queue` (see screenshot below). If your terminal supports `curses`, you can interactively browse the tree and collapse/uncollapse its nodes.

## Merge Scenarios

When working with an application state, we need to consider different scenarios, including:

*TODO: insert figure to illustrate the scenarios*

- starting from an empty state, injecting cloud pod state s1
- starting from an existing state s0
    - injecting cloud pod state s1 into the instance, overwriting any existing state
    - merging cloud pod state s1 into the instance to create the union of s0 and s1
    - â€¦

To cover the different scenarios, cloud pods support different merge strategies. â€¦

# Cloud Pods Use Cases

Next, letâ€™s highlight some of the exciting use cases that cloud pods are enabling. As a â€¦

## Sharing state for collaborative debugging

Cloud Pods can be easily shared between team members and can be used to foster collaborative debugging. Let us present a simple use case. Bob is working on a new feature that uses three AWS services, namely SQS, Lambda, and Secrets Manager. He is aiming at implementing the following workflow: each time a message hits the SQS queue, a Lambda is automatically fired. Such a Lambda checks for a secret stored in Secrets Manager and return its details. Bob writes his Lambda and creates the necessary resources. Finally, he tries to send a message to the queue to test the end-to-end logic. Unfortunately, something seems odd: the Lambda returns a 500 error while attempting to fetch the secret.

After a couple of attempts, Bob asks for help from his colleague Alice. Alice is very happy to do so. She asks him to push a Cloud Pod from his troublesome LocalStack instance. Bob pushes the pod and Alice pulls it on the local machine. After digging a bit, Alice finds out that there is a region mismatch between the `boto` client used in the Lambda function and the other AWS resources previously created. Therefore, she fixed the Lambda code and pushes a version of the Cloud Pod. She simply tells Bob to pull the new version and to try out the new code by sending a message to the queue. Bob thanks Alice and finally can run his implementation end-to-end with no errors ðŸš€

## Pre-seeding CI environments

One of the most paramount use cases of LocalStack is its usage within various Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) environments. If you are running automated tests in CI, you might often feel the need to create test fixtures or additional resources to bootstrap your testing environment and test your application. Cloud Pods can dramatically facilitate such a task.

Let us imagine the following example. Pikachu GmbH uses an AWS ECS cluster to deploy its flagship software. They have a dedicated platform team that is responsible to manage such a cluster and making it available to the development team. To facilitate the end-to-end testing, this team is also responsible to create and manage a Cloud Pod containing the state of the ECS cluster. This pod is available in the organization storage space at Pikachu GmbH and can be pulled both by each member of the organization and from within the CI environment. This way, the Cloud Pod can be used in CI to bootstrap the testing environment where the application is then deployed and tested. Moreover, each individual developer can pull the same image and run some local tests. This approach is quite flexible. Indeed, every time that some changes to the ECS cluster configuration need to be done, the platform team will simply push an update to the same pod: the new version will be seamlessly be available everywhere at the next pull operation.

### Creating reproducible application samples

Another prime use case for using cloud pods is to prepare reproducible application samples. For example, in the area of Machine Learning (ML), it is common practice to provide training data sets along with the code logic used to compute ML models, in order to make results easily reproducible.

Letâ€™s assume we want to train an ML model that can recognize handwritten digits on an image. Cloud pods can help us create a reproducible sample - consider the simple application illustrated below: an S3 bucket contains the training data (image files with digits), a Lambda function defines the code for training the ML model, and a Lambda layer provides the dependencies of the ML library (e.g., `scikit-learn`).

{{< img src="reproducible_samples.png" >}}

We can prepare this cloud pod, push it to the LocalStack platform, and then share it with our team - once available, it becomes as simple as running `localstack pod pull --name ml-pod` to replicate and run the app locally. The code for this sample is available here (**TODO add link**).

# Tech Deep Dive - How does it work under the covers?

Support for cloud pods has been a sizeable engineering effort in LocalStack, and we continue to fine-tune the implementation and user experience. We have introduced several abstractions that build the foundation for how cloud pods are working internally:

- **Cloud pods version store**: Each cloud pod has a set of metadata files associated which define the versions, revisions, commits, and state files that have been created for the cloud pod.
- **State merging**: Different mechanisms are being used to deal with diverging local and remote states when pulling cloud pods to the local machine. In the simplest case, we simply overwrite the local state with the content of the cloud pod. More advanced use cases involve merging of service states - using a generic mechanism for merging Python backend objects, as well as specialized mechanisms for merging service-specific persistence files (e.g., sqlite files)
- **Metamodel extraction**: In addition to storing the actual binary content to fully replicate a service state, weâ€™re also extracting a metamodel of the cloud pod content, which represents a human-readable format that can be easily displayed via the CLI or in the Web user interface.

# Conclusions and Next Steps

Weâ€™re thrilled to get this next evolution of cloud pods to our users, which is available as part of our Team product tier as of now. If youâ€™d like to give it a try, head over to [https://app.localstack.cloud](https://app.localstack.cloud) and sign up for the free trial!

We see cloud pods as a foundational technology that enables entirely new ways for how cloud applications are being developed - from managing and evolving application state, to preseeding CI test environments, to enabling collaborative debugging within your team.

In the future, we continue to explore use cases and usage patterns for cloud pods - â€¦
