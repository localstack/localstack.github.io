With the rise of the LocalStack Community on GitHub, Slack, and Social-media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter, we have received a lot of feedback from our users. These feedbacks range from new feature requests for our LocalStack Team and Web Application platform, bug reports, enhancements, and further additions from various developers distributed across our user base. 

We have been handling these requests through our GitHub Issue tracker, which has been limited to our open-sourced cloud emulation and doesn't cover our premium features. To address this and collaborate with our community better, we announce the all-new LocalStack Discussion Pages. 

LocalStack Discuss form is also a positive step in engaging with our community members and listening to their feedback. While our Slack community is limited to taking immediate bug reports and feature requests and working with our community from a close quarter, our Discussion Pages will help developers to give us feedback, join the discussions on our core emulation framework, Team & Enterprise product, and future direction of LocalStack as a company.

## Being a part of LocalStack Discuss

The LocalStack Discussion Pages will be the dedicated place to discuss topics and questions related to:

- Discussions and announcements about LocalStack Pro and Community releases.
- LocalStack Documentation, reference guides, case studies, and more.
- Useful LocalStack tips, tricks, and best practices for developing your cloud & serverless applications locally.
- Contributing to the LocalStack Community codebase and steering the development of our open-source projects.
- Send constructive feedback about LocalStack as a product and as a company and how we can do better!

However, it will not be a place for ad-hoc reports or support questions; Please connect with our support team on [Slack](https://localstack.cloud/contact) or create a GitHub issue on our open-source [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues) for our help with your issues.

Create an account on [discuss.localstack.cloud](https://discuss.localstack.cloud/) and discuss away!

## Getting started with LocalStack Discuss

If you are new to Discourse, consider looking at [Discourse New User guide](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-new-user-guide/96331), which provides intuitive tips to use the pages, text formatting, images, hyperlinks, and more! 

Our Discussion Pages has an initial selection of categories which we can adjust over time:

- Announcements: Announcing LocalStack features, product updates, and any upcoming news that we should notify our broader community!
- Feature Requests: Requests for new features or suggestions to improve the existing ones!
- Platform: Questions, bugs, feedback on the product workflow alongside dashboard, integration, documentation, and more!
- Wizards: Share your LocalStack workflow, best practices, and suggestions for improving the development & testing workflow for the next generation of cloud & serverless developers!

To ensure that you are up-to-date about the recent happenings with LocalStack, we will also notify you via email! Using our Discussion Pages, you can edit your email preferences and define how often you want to receive emails. We suggest you mute any topic or category that doesn't interest you for a clutter-free mailbox!

## Conclusion

At LocalStack, we are rapidly growing, and we will be further using our Discuss community to share upcoming updates on our product. We will be closely communicating with the conversations, iterate on our product and post the updates as and when we ship it.

Letâ€™s work together and make cloud development real fun! ðŸš€
