We are excited to announce that LocalStack is now available in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-lllzw3ywntoxg?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa). LocalStack is the leading platform for local development and testing of cloud applications. LocalStack's Cloud Emulator allows you to effectively run over 80 AWS services directly on your local machine and on CI/CD systems to significantly cut down on development time and feedback cycles. At its core, LocalStack provides a growing ecosystem of native integrations that encompasses crucial components such as CI/CD providers, application development frameworks, programming language SDKs, Infrastructure-as-Code tools, and more.

Our mission is to give developers back control over their environments and free them from wasting time with inefficient dev & test loops in the cloud, so they can instead focus on developing great products to solve the world's problems. This milestone holds significant value for our users as it grants developer teams the freedom to leverage their AWS budget effectively while harnessing the capabilities of LocalStack's emulation features. This synergy with diverse cloud developer tools has the potential to revolutionize the way developers build, test and deploy their AWS-powered applications today!

Through LocalStack’s AWS Marketplace integration, you will get access to our [core emulation layer](https://localstack.cloud/solutions/cloud-emulation/) that offers advanced support for extended AWS services and features, along with [team collaboration features](https://localstack.cloud/solutions/team-collaboration/) through the LocalStack Team edition.

The LocalStack Team edition delivers a range of features aimed at enhancing your cloud productivity while seamlessly aligning with your existing workflows. These features are designed to reduce friction and adapt as your infrastructure & workflows scale, with:

- **Cloud Pods**: Store a persistent snapshot of your LocalStack instance in the Web Application and inject Cloud Pods from your team members into your LocalStack instance for collaborative debugging.
- **Stack Insights**: Access AWS usage telemetry, including service invocations, the user agent and the particular service during a specific LocalStack spin-up to enable deep debugging within your team.
- **LocalStack in CI**: Spin up LocalStack in your CI pipelines to run tests before pushing out changes to production or to create ephemeral environments to showcase your changes with LocalStack.
- **LocalStack Extensions**: Extend and customise LocalStack to integrate custom service emulators, such as Cloudflare & Stripe, into your LocalStack instance to enable your team go beyond AWS.

With LocalStack now available in the AWS Marketplace, you can leverage a streamlined procurement to get easy access to our cloud development platform.

## Subscribing to LocalStack on the AWS Marketplace

To launch LocalStack with AWS Marketplace, you can follow the steps below:

- Go to **AWS Marketplace Subscriptions** in the AWS Console and locate **LocalStack** under **Discover Products**.

- Review the terms, select the desired number of seats, contract renewal strategy, and accept the contract. Accepting the contract will initiate a Marketplace subscription.
- Once the contract is accepted, you'll be prompted to finalize the order by clicking a button. You'll then be directed to the LocalStack Web Application, where you need to authenticate by signing in or signing up.

You can make subscription adjustments by navigating to **Modify Current Contract** or **Modify Renewal Terms** on the AWS Marketplace.

## Next Steps

In the era of rapid digital transformation, organizations embrace DevOps for agile software delivery, yet struggle with deployment delays, security issues, and cost management.
