We are excited to announce that LocalStack is now available in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-lllzw3ywntoxg?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa). LocalStack is the leading platform for local development and testing of cloud applications. LocalStack's Cloud Emulator allows you to effectively emulate over 80 AWS services directly on your local machine and on CI/CD systems to significantly cut down on development time and development. At its core, LocalStack provides a growing ecosystem of integrations that encompasses crucial components such as CI/CD providers, Application Development frameworks, Programming Language SDKs, Infrastructure-as-Code tools, and more. 

Our mission is to give developers back control over their environments and free them from wasting time with inefficient dev & test loops in the cloud, so they can instead focus on developing great products to solve the world's problems. This milestone holds significant value for our users as it grants developer teams the freedom to leverage their AWS budget effectively while harnessing the capabilities of LocalStack's emulation features. This synergy with diverse cloud developer tools has the potential to revolutionize the way developers build, test and deploy their AWS-powered applications today!

## Leveraging LocalStack through AWS Marketplace

Through LocalStackâ€™s AWS Marketplace integration,, you will get access to our [base emulation layer](https://localstack.cloud/solutions/cloud-emulation/) that offers advanced support for extended AWS services and features, along with [team collaboration features](https://localstack.cloud/solutions/team-collaboration/) through the LocalStack Team edition.

The LocalStack Team edition delivers a range of features aimed at enhancing your cloud productivity while seamlessly aligning with your existing workflows. These features are designed to reduce friction and adapt as your infrastructure & workflows scale, with:

- **Cloud Pods**: Store a persistent snapshot of your LocalStack instance in the Web Application and inject Cloud Pods from your team members into your LocalStack instance for collaborative debugging.
- **Stack Insights**: Access AWS usage telemetry, including service invocations, the user agent and the particular service during a specific LocalStack spin-up to enable deep debugging within your team.
- **LocalStack in CI**: Spin up LocalStack in your CI pipelines to run tests before pushing out changes to production or to create ephemeral environments to showcase your changes with LocalStack.
- **LocalStack Extensions**: Extend and customise LocalStack to integrate custom service emulators, such as Cloudflare & Stripe, into your LocalStack instance to enable your team go beyond AWS.

With LocalStack now available in the AWS Marketplace, you can quickly leverage a streamlined procurement to access our cloud development framework. 

## Next Steps

In the era of rapid digital transformation, organizations embrace DevOps for agile software delivery, yet struggle with deployment delays, security issues, and cost management. Overcoming these challenges requires efficiency and agility to streamline development & testing cycles and maximize the impact of DevOps practices.

LocalStack enables local cloud sanboxes, aiding developers and cutting down inefficient dev&test loops in software workflows. LocalStack's listing in the AWS Marketplace is a step towards making local cloud sanboxes for development & testing accessible to AWS customers.
