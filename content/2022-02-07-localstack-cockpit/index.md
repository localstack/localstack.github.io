The new [LocalStack Cockpit](https://localstack.cloud/products/cockpit/) is now available. LocalStack Cockpit is a fully-integrated desktop experience for our LocalStack users. It allows our users to control, access, and manage LocalStack with a click of a button. No matter if you are a seasoned LocalStack user or just starting up to use LocalStack, Cockpit helps you use LocalStack more effectively!

## Getting started

You can now download the LocalStack Cockpit from our [website](https://localstack.cloud) by signing up for our v0.1.0 beta release.
