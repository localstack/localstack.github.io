The LocalStack community focuses on servicing the users, contributors and the open-source culture that has heralded our flagship open-source software! Our community works together on multiple fronts: filing issues and creating pull requests, providing community support to users, advocating for its adoption among the wider community, and helping us further innovate our project.
  
The community page aims to serve our diverse contributors to discover ways in which they can involve with the rest of the community, stay up-to-date with the recent news and events, and discover how they can contribute to our projects.
