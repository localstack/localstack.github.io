## About LocalStack

We are a young, fast-growing remote first startup out of Zurich with employees around the globe. At LocalStack, we’re building world-class tooling to support highly efficient dev & test loops for cloud application developers. Our core product is LocalStack Pro - a light-weight sandbox running in Docker that allows engineers to develop & test AWS cloud applications entirely on their local machines. We also have a large and active open source community (49k+ stars on GitHub with 170+ million downloads.) 

### About the role

With growing interest from Fortune Global 1000 companies in our Enterprise offering, we are looking for a seasoned Account Executive to help us capitalize on this traction. This is an exciting opportunity to get on board a growing multinational tech company early stage and shape our growth journey. Join us for the ride!

### What you will do

- Source, schedule, demo, and close deals end to end.
- Qualify and pursue inbound opportunities.
- Conduct outbound prospecting to build a strong pipeline.
- Lead product demos and technical POC’s with prospects.
- Collaborate with your SE, CS, Support, and Engineering to provide a white glove experience.
- Relay customer feedback and insights to the team to inform our roadmap.
- Report directly to the Head of Sales and Customer Success.

### Your profile

- 3-8 years of successful closing experience in B2B tech sales, ideally with a focus on developer technologies.
- Based out of the East Coast USA.
- Proven track record of exceeding quota.
- Experience writing and architecting applications, preferably on AWS.
- Familiarity with the Developer workflow and common pain points.
- The ability to discuss complex, technical topics with brevity.
- Have previously worked at a Startup and familiar with that environment.

### What we offer

We offer an energetic, dynamic, productive, and flexible work environment, where you’ll be working with some of the brightest minds who are truly shaping the future of cloud software development. Given our current trajectory as a company, we offer outstanding opportunities for professional growth and the possibility to deeply shape things from the ground up. We provide 401(k) matching as well as full medical benefits for this role. Compensation range is provided upon the first phone interview.

We provide a remote-friendly work environment, and can accommodate flexible work hours (and timezones). We focus on output rather than process, and try to keep things as lean and agile as possible, to achieve the best possible efficiency and velocity. We are currently working in a remote setup spread across different geos - with part of the core team based in Zurich/Switzerland and Vienna/Austria (among other locations), and a focus on expanding into the US.
