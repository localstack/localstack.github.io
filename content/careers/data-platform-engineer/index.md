### About LocalStack

We are a young, fast-growing startup, headquartered in Zurich/Switzerland with a development office in Vienna/Austria and remote team members from around the world (incl. US, FR, UK, IN, MX, IE). At LocalStack, we’re building world-class tooling to support highly efficient dev&test feedback loops for cloud application developers. Our core product is the LocalStack cloud emulator - a light-weight cloud sandbox running in Docker that allows our users to develop cloud applications entirely on their local machines. 

LocalStack has a large and active open source community (49k+ stars on GitHub) with several 100k active users worldwide and 180M+ downloads to date. With a growing international customer base across Fortune Global 500 companies for our Pro and Enterprise offerings, as well as a growing, globally distributed team of top-notch engineers and GTM experts, we are on an exciting growth journey to become the world’s leading platform for local cloud software development.

### About the role

We are looking for a Data Platform Engineer with a successful track record of building scalable data pipelines and generating insights from large amounts of structured and unstructured data. 

Building on the stellar success of our high-fidelity core cloud emulator, we are increasingly building value-add features that support the software-development lifecycle (SDLC) for cloud applications - including Cloud Pods (persistence mechanism for team collaboration), Stack Insights (detailed telemetry for application debugging), as well as the emerging feature of LocalStack Previews (ephemeral cloud sandboxes for application previews). As the number of customers and platform features is growing, so are our data challenges. Our vast amount of product telemetry data allows us to gain valuable insights into service usage, common usage patterns, as well as gaps and opportunities in the product. To help with prioritization in the GTM team and to proactively support our customers, we have recently started doubling down on customer observability based on real-time insights. Moreover, as our platform is growing, we aim to further foster data-driven decision making and systematic user feedback for all product development and work prioritization.

This role will be a key enabler in supporting the increasing number of data use cases emerging across the different departments at LocalStack. The day-to-day activities involve working with various data sources, optimizing data pipelines, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to enable data-driven decision making across the organization. We’re looking for someone who has a proactive can-do attitude, exhibits a pragmatic approach to solving problems, and enjoys working on a broad range of tasks in a fast-paced startup environment.



### Your profile
- **Proven track record of building data pipelines:** Build and operate data pipelines, ETL processes, and data integration solutions. Must be proficient with Python and SQL.
- **Experience in writing code that scales:** Optimize data infrastructure for scalability and performance, ensuring that it can handle increasing volumes of data.
- **Data Architecture:** Design and implement data architectures that support the storage, processing, and analysis of large datasets.
- **Cloud Technologies:** Work with AWS to deploy and manage data services.
- **Team player who enjoys collaborating:** Work with engineers, product owners, customer success, sales, and other key stakeholders to understand their data needs and provide solutions to enable data-driven decision making.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation of data platform processes and procedures.
- **Bonus:** Experience with Clickhouse



### What we offer

We offer an energetic, dynamic, productive, and flexible work environment, where you’ll be working with some of the brightest minds who are truly shaping the future of cloud software development. Given our current trajectory as a company, we offer outstanding opportunities for professional growth and the possibility to deeply shape things from the ground up, with high prestige and visibility in the cloud developer community. We can offer competitive salary packages which will generally depend upon your level of expertise and experience.

We provide a remote-friendly work environment, and can accommodate flexible work hours (and timezones). We focus on output rather than process, and try to keep things as lean and agile as possible, to achieve the best possible efficiency and velocity. We are currently working in a remote setup spread across different geos - with part of the core team based in Zurich/Switzerland and Vienna/Austria, and remote locations around the world.
