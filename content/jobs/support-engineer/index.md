### About LocalStack

We are a young, fast-growing startup, headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, with a development office in Vienna, Austria and remote employees from around the world. At LocalStack, we’re building world-class tooling to support highly efficient dev&test loops for cloud application developers. Our core product is the LocalStack cloud emulator - a light-weight cloud sandbox running in Docker that allows our users to develop cloud applications entirely on their local machines, or run tests against a local cloud in their CI pipelines. LocalStack has a large and active open source community (37k+ stars on Github, 7500 Slack members) with several 100k active users worldwide. With a growing international customer base for our Pro and Enterprise offerings, as well as a growing, globally distributed team of top-notch engineers and BizDev experts, we are on an exciting growth journey to become the world’s leading platform for local cloud software development.

### About the role

As support engineer, you are instrumental in driving the adoption of our technology by helping customers be successful with LocalStack. Support engineers at LocalStack are deeply embedded into the engineering team and act as the nexus between LocalStack’s growing user base and our core developers. We have an active Slack workspace with over 7500 users, and a Slack and GitHub support process. Our pro user often have a diverse tech stack, where they integrate different types of Cloud applications tools with LocalStack. Issues can range from simple configuration mishaps to complex integration challenges that require analytical skills and a good understanding of cloud development tooling. Most of our users are deeply technical, and each user issue solved is an opportunity to improve the product. That can mean improving the documentation, requesting the help of engineers to fix bugs, making suggestions for new features, or even getting your hands dirty by digging into the codebase yourself.

If you want to be a driving force in making cloud development fun again, we would love to have you on the team!
