### About the role

We are looking for an experienced **Senior Frontend Engineer** to spearhead the growth journey of the LocalStack web application [app.localstack.cloud](https://app.localstack.cloud).
You will work together with talented full-stack engineers to build out LocalStack’s Pro and Enterprise features, and take charge over the frontend components.
Our frontend tech stack centers around Typescript/React and Material UI.
We are also exploring desktop UI experiences using React in Electron.
We have a growing Pro customer base that increasingly uses the web app of our SaaS offering.
You will be a driving force in creating an enjoyable user experience for our users, while maintaining a clean and scalable codebase, and drive the development of new features.
The work at LocalStack is a balanced mix of maintaining existing product code and greenfield new projects that you can shape and drive.

If you want to be a driving force in making cloud development fun again, we would love to have you on the team!

### Your Profile

- English language proficiency
- 3+ years of professional experience in software development and web engineering
- Solid experience with Typescript and React
- Cares deeply about code quality and re-usability, but understands the inherent trade-offs of moving fast and delivering a product
- Experience with team collaboration workflows with Git and GitHub
- A curious mind willing to learn and grow

    - Experience with managed services on AWS or other cloud providers
    - Experience with system architecture and architectural design

    - Basic understanding of DevOps automation
    - Leading a software team

### What we offer

We offer an energetic, dynamic, productive, and flexible work environment, where you’ll be working with some of the brightest minds who are truly shaping the future of cloud software development. Given our current trajectory as a company, we offer outstanding opportunities for professional growth and the possibility to deeply shape things from the ground up. We can offer competitive salary packages which will generally depend upon your level of expertise and experience.

We provide a remote-friendly work environment, and can accommodate flexible work hours (and timezones). We focus on output rather than process, and try to keep things as lean and agile as possible, to achieve the best possible efficiency and velocity. We are currently working in a remote setup spread across different geos - with part of the core team based in Zurich/Switzerland and Vienna/Austria, and remote locations around the world.
