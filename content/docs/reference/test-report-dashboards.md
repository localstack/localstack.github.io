LocalStack allows for transparent collection of execution events, in order to provide usage analytics and insights into the testing process overall. Simply configure your system with the `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` environment variable, and the system will start making your events accessible on the LocalStack dashboard at https://app.localstack.cloud/dashboard.

Please note that data privacy is one of our key concerns; data is only collected in an anonymized way, and never exposes any sensitive information about your application.
