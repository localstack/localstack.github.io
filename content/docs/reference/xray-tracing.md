LocalStack Pro allows to instrument your applications using [XRay](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) tracing. This helps in optimizing the interactions between service calls, and facilitates debugging of performance bottlenecks.

For example, a Python Lambda function can be instrumented as follows (based on the example [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-tracing.html)):
```
import boto3
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
from aws_xray_sdk.core import patch
patch(['boto3'])
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket='mybucket')
    xray_recorder.begin_subsegment('my_code')
    # your function code goes here...
    xray_recorder.end_subsegment()
```
Running this code in Lambda on LocalStack will result in two trace segments being created in XRay - one from the instrumented `boto3` client when running `create_bucket(..)`, and one for the custom subsegment denoted `'my_code'`. You can use the regular XRay API calls (e.g., [`GetTraceSummaries`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetTraceSummaries.html), [`BatchGetTraces`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_BatchGetTraces.html)) to retrieve the details (timestamps, IDs, etc) of these segments.
