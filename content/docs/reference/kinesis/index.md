The Kinesis Data Analytics API allows you to run continuous SQL queries directly over your Kinesis data streams. Basic support is included in LocalStack Pro - it allows you to create Kinesis Analytics applications, define input and output streams and schema types, and run continuous queries locally.

A simple example has been added to [this sample repository on Github](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-pro-samples/tree/master/kinesis-analytics). More details are following soon.
