Users receive an invite after signing up to the LocalStack app on [app.localstack.cloud](https://app.localstack.cloud). You can also directly sign-up for our Slack workspace through our [Slack invite](http://slack.localstack.cloud/). Otherwise please reach out to [support@localstack.cloud](mailto:support@localstack.cloud).
