question: "How many CI Credits do I get?"

Your CI key offers a certain monthly number of available credits, depending on the number of individual user seats you have purchased. Each subscription (both Pro and Team) comes with the number of chosen individual developer keys to be configured on each developer's machine, plus one extra CI key (at no additional charge) which allows you to use LocalStack in your CI environment. 

For example, if you have purchased 8 Pro seats, the CI key would come with 200 CI credits (100 base credits for the first three users and 20 additional credits for users 4-10). In case you purchase 8 Team seats, the CI key would come with 2000 CI credits (1000 base credits for the first three users plus 200 additional credits for users 4-10).

Please note that the Pro subscription is intended for use on individual user machines and the CI credits offered in Pro are mainly intended for demonstrative purposes, so you can set up and test how LocalStack performs in your CI pipelines. If you are planning to use LocalStack extensively across your CI/CD environments, the Team plan will be the right one for you.
