You can create new subscriptions on [Account billing section](https://app.localstack.cloud/account#billing) by using the **+ ADD NEW PLAN** button.

Please note, if you are part of an organization account, only your organization’s admins have access to the billing section and can assign API keys to you in the member section at [Account members section](https://app.localstack.cloud/account#members).
