LocalStack is a platform that simplifies and accelerates development of cloud applications. At its core, LocalStack provides a cloud service emulation layer that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment. With LocalStack, you can run your AWS services or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider.

LocalStack focuses on developer experience (DevX) and offers a number of team collaboration features on top of the core emulation layer, like advanced persistence mechanisms that allow reuse and sharing of resources among team members and across environments. For enterprises LocalStack also comes with advanced analytics and reporting mechanisms.
