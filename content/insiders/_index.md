### Fellow Developers!

We are starting the LocalStack Insiders program and for this first installment we are looking for users of all experience levels who are using LocalStack non-commercially.

We are currently working on making LocalStack more accessible and to bring it to a wider audience:

 - Try out the improved onboarding and getting started developer experience.
 - Get access to the LocalStack Insiders slack channel.
 - Join our office hours and talk directly to LocalStack core developers and members of the devRel team.

**To value your participation, we want to offer insiders LocalStack for free** for non-commercial use!

Sign up now for the waiting list! We are looking forward to inviting the first users into the Insiders program in the coming weeks!

\- Your team at LocalStack
