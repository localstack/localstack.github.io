By using the LocalStack Platform or LocalStack App ("Services"), or any other service operated by its owner LocalStack GmbH of Switzerland ("LocalStack"), the person or organization ("Customer" or "you") is agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms"). By accepting these Terms, signing an Order, or using the Services, you represent that you are of legal age and have the authority to bind the Customer to the Order and these Terms.

If LocalStack makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our site before the changes are effective. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to these Terms. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.

Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.

## API USAGE TERMS
Customers may access their LocalStack account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses LocalStack, is bound by these Terms plus the following specific terms:

   1. You expressly understand and agree that LocalStack shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if LocalStack has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.
   1. Abuse or excessively frequent requests to LocalStack via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API. LocalStack, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. LocalStack will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.
   1. LocalStack reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

## ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICES

### Right to Use Services

You may use our Services only as permitted in these Terms. Technical support for the Services is described in the Service Descriptions. If your affiliates use our Services, you warrant that you have the authority to bind those affiliates and you will be liable if your affiliates do not comply with the Agreement. The Service Descriptions are incorporated into these Terms. You understand that your personal data may be processed in connection with your use of our Services, software, and websites which are provided via equipment and resources located in the United States and other locations throughout the world.

### Limitations on Use

### Changes to Services

We reserve the right to enhance, upgrade, improve, or modify features of our Services as we deem appropriate and in our discretion. We will not materially reduce the core functionality (as set forth in the Service Descriptions) or discontinue any Services unless we provide you with prior written notice. We may offer additional functionality to our standard Services or premium feature improvements for an additional cost.

### Proprietary Rights and LocalStack Marks

You acknowledge that we retain all proprietary right, title and interest in the Services, our name, logo or other marks (together, the "LocalStack Marks"), and any related intellectual property rights, including, without limitation, all modifications, enhancements, derivative works, and upgrades thereto. You agree that you will not use or register any trademark, service mark, business name, domain name or social media account name or handle which incorporates in whole or in part the LocalStack Marks or is similar to any of these.

## ORDERS, FEES AND PAYMENT

### Orders

You may order Services using our then-current ordering processes ("Order"). All Orders are effective on the date you submit your Order. Acceptance of your Order may be subject to our verification and credit approval process. Each Order shall be treated as a separate and independent Order.

### Payment, Fees, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms

All paid plans must enter a valid payment account. You are responsible for providing accurate and current billing, contact and payment information to us. You agree that we may take steps to verify whether your payment method is valid, charge your payment card or bill you for all amounts due for your use of the Services. You agree that your credit card information and related personal data may be provided to third parties for payment processing and fraud prevention purposes. We may suspend or terminate your Services if at any time we determine that your payment information is inaccurate or not current, and you are responsible for fees and overdraft charges that we may incur when we charge your card for payment. You agree to pay all applicable, undisputed fees for the Services on the terms set forth on the invoice. Except as set forth in Section 3.3 below or in the Service Descriptions, any and all payments you make to us for access to the Services are final and non-refundable. An upgrade of your plan will immediately bill you. For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. LocalStack does not accept any liability for such loss. We reserve the right to update the price for Services at any time after your Initial Term, and price changes will be effective as of your next billing cycle. We will notify you of any price changes by publishing on our website, emailing, quoting or invoicing you.

### Sales, Promotional Offers, Coupons and Pricing

Sales, promotions and other special discounted pricing offers are temporary and, upon the renewal of your subscription, any such discounted pricing offers may expire. We reserve the right to discontinue or modify any coupons, credits, sales and special promotional offers in our sole discretion.

### Disputes; Delinquent Accounts

You must notify us of any fee dispute within 15 days of the invoice date, and once resolved, you agree to pay those fees within 15 days. We may, on notice to you, suspend or terminate your Services if you do not pay undisputed fees, and you agree to reimburse us for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in collecting delinquent amounts.

### Taxes and Withholding

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties. You are responsible for all applicable sales, services, value-added, goods and services, withholding, tariffs and similar taxes or fees (collectively, "Taxes and Fees") imposed by any government entity or collecting agency based on the Services, except those Taxes and Fees based on our net income, or Taxes and Fees for which you have provided an exemption certificate. Additionally, if you do not satisfy your Tax and Fees obligations, you agree that you will be required to reimburse us for any Taxes and Fees paid on your behalf, and we may take steps to collect Taxes and Fees we have paid on your behalf. In all cases, you will pay the amounts due under this Agreement to us in full without any right of set-off or deduction.


## TERM AND TERMINATION

### Term

The initial term commitment for your purchase of Services will be as specified on an Order ("Initial Term") and begins on the Effective Date. After the Initial Term, the Services will, unless otherwise specified in the Service Description for a particular Service, automatically renew for additional 12-month periods ("Renewal Terms"), unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before the current term expires. You may provide notice of non-renewal for each Service you do not wish to renew at https://app.localstack.cloud. We may agree to align the invoicing under multiple Orders but this will not reduce the term of any Order. Terminating specific Services does not affect the term of any other Services still in effect. If we permit you to reinstate Services at any time after termination, you agree that you will be bound by the then-current Terms and the renewal date that was in effect as of the effective termination date.

### Termination for Cause

Either party may terminate the Agreement (i) if the other party breaches its material obligations and fails to cure within 30 days of receipt of written notice, or (ii) if the other party becomes insolvent or bankrupt, liquidated or is dissolved, or ceases substantially all of its business, and we may suspend access or terminate immediately if you breach Section 1.2, 4 or 5.

### Effect of Termination

If the Agreement or any Services are terminated, your account may be converted to a "free" or "basic" version of the Service, if available, at our discretion. Otherwise, you will immediately discontinue all use of the terminated Services, except that upon request, we will provide you with limited access to the Services for a period not to exceed 30 days, solely to enable you to retrieve your Content (defined further below) from the Services. We have no obligation to maintain your Content after that period. Neither party will be liable for any damages resulting from termination of the Agreement, and termination will not affect any claim arising prior to the effective termination date. If we discontinue Services or materially reduce the core functionality in accordance with Section 1.3 above, the related Order will be terminated and we will provide you with a pro rata refund of any prepaid, unused fees. You agree to pay for any use of the Services past the date of expiration or termination which have not been converted to a free version of the Service.

### Survival

The provisions of Sections 2 (Orders, Fees and Payment), 3.3 (Effect of Termination), 4 (Your Content and Accounts), 7 (Indemnification), 8 (Limitation on Liability), 9.6 (No Class Actions), 9.11 (Notices), and 9.14 (Contracting Party, Choice of Law and Location for Resolving Disputes) survive any termination of the Agreement.
