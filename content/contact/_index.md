## Getting in touch

Below you can find some pointers for contacting us, as well as getting in touch with the community.

### Issues and Bug Reports

For any bug reports, please first consult the main Github repository: [https://github.com/localstack/localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack). Chances are that a similar issue may have already been posted by other users in the past. Github has an excellent search function, which may help find existing answers to your questions.

If you cannot find a solution in the existing issues, please raise a bug report directly in Github. By tagging the issue with the label `PRO`, we'll try our best to prioritize your request.

Please make sure to always include the following details in your bug report:
* Details about your environment (operating system, LocalStack version)
* Exact command used to start LocalStack
* Any error logs from the console (try using `DEBUG=1` to increase the log level)
* Expected and actual behavior
* Ideally, a small self-contained example project to reproduce your issue
