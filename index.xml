An integral part of infrastructure operations is reacting in real-time to anomalous changes in metrics, e.g., spiking disk or CPU usage or failures in your serverless functions. This is where CloudWatch metric alarms and actions come into play, which you can now develop and test using LocalStack!</description></item><item><title>Debug Lambda functions from your IDE using LocalStack</title><link>/blog/2022-05-09-debug-your-lamda-functions-from-your-ide-using-localstack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 05:08:41 +0530</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022-05-09-debug-your-lamda-functions-from-your-ide-using-localstack/</guid><description>In the previous blog, we checked out how to hot-swap Lambda functions locally using LocalStack. Using LocalStack, you can execute your Lambda functions locally without the need to deploy them to AWS. This is a great way to test your code and learn more about how your Lambda functions work before deploying them to AWS. But there is always a question about debugging the Lambda functions from your IDE before deploying it.</description></item><item><title>LocalStack — 40K stars, 90M pulls and an engaged community!</title><link>/blog/2022-04-22-localstack-40k-stars-90m-pulls-and-an-engaged-community/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 10:34:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022-04-22-localstack-40k-stars-90m-pulls-and-an-engaged-community/</guid><description>LocalStack provides a local cloud development platform that simplifies developing, testing, and debugging cloud apps locally and across CI/CD. Our core emulation service which provides emulated LocalStack Cloud APIs (currently focused on AWS cloud), is shipped as a Docker image and is currently being used by a large and active open source community with over 100K active users worldwide.
We recently crossed 40,000 Stargazers over GitHub and hit a new milestone of over 90,000,000 Docker pulls.</description></item><item><title>Develop and Test Real-time Data Pipelines with LocalStack</title><link>/blog/2022-04-04-develop-and-test-data-analytics-pipelines-on-localstack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022-04-04-develop-and-test-data-analytics-pipelines-on-localstack/</guid><description>At LocalStack, we rely on AWS Lambda as a key part of our serverless infrastructure toolkit. As with any critical service, we want to extract analytics event data from running Lambda functions and aggregate it in our data warehouse so that we can track user stories and squash bugs. But this presents a challenge: how can we emit detailed analytics data while keeping Lambda code simple and performant?</description></item><item><title>Hot Swapping Python Lambda Functions using LocalStack</title><link>/blog/2022-03-07-hot-swapping-python-lambda-functions-using-localstack/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 08:53:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022-03-07-hot-swapping-python-lambda-functions-using-localstack/</guid><description>AWS Lambda is a Serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) system that allows you to write code in your favorite programming language and run it on the AWS ecosystem. Unlike deploying your code on a server, you can now break down your application into many independent functions and deploy them as a singular units. With the help of AWS Lambda, you can strive for more modular code that can be tested and debugged while integrated with the AWS infrastructure and your core system.</description></item><item><title>Introducing LocalStack Cockpit</title><link>/blog/2022-02-07-localstack-cockpit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 13:10:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022-02-07-localstack-cockpit/</guid><description>The new LocalStack Cockpit is now available.

It also helps prevent scary cloud bills at the end of every month! LocalStack has an amazing community of users, contributors, and supporters - and generally demonstrates a very strong commitment to supporting open source.
The community uses LocalStack for many use cases such as developing microservice cloud applications. One of the strongest use cases why developers use LocalStack is “testing”.</description></item><item><title>LocalStack: 30k stars, 40M pulls - and just getting started! 🚀</title><link>/blog/2021-05-06-localstack-40k-stars/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 14:48:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021-05-06-localstack-40k-stars/</guid><description>While cloud environments offer great characteristics for production workloads (high scalability, reliability, cost efficiency), the dev experience often falls short due to the centralized, remote execution model of clouds.
Developers are faced with a slow and tedious code → deploy → test → redeploy → &amp;hellip; cycle and often find themselves packaging and uploading their serverless applications tens or hundreds of times a day. These inherent limitations and hurdles in developing cloud applications have caused some folks to compare the cloud to the new mainframe era.</description></item></channel></rss>
